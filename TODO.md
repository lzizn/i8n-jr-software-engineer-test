MUST:
filter PRODUCT

create user schema, create auth routes and middlware

create ORDER schema, add endpoint to create order

creation of GIN Indexes

fetch and validate supplier API's instead of mocks

add readme.md

good:
fix that mapper issue

better tests (use lib request to create e2e tests)

search on mapping DB-structures and turn into TS-types, there's no way we need to maintain this MANUALLY... I feel like a monkey doing that.
